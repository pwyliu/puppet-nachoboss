WORKDIR README
====================================
This is the working directory for Puppet module `<%= @module_name %>`.
You should leave this directory alone unless you want to rerun installation.

EXPLAIN
====================================
This module downloads and extracts a tarball to install a program. After
install, the module cleans up the tarball and leaves behind this directory and
some dotfiles. The dotfiles let the Puppet agent know that we are done our
operations and to not rerun them.

I WANT TO REINSTALL
====================================
To rerun installation, delete this working directory. This will cause the agent
to rerun its manifest. MAKE SURE you have uninstalled the daemon in question
or there will be problems when you try to reinstall something that is already
installed. Duh.

THIS IS A REAL DUMB WAY TO INSTALL THINGS
====================================
Agreed. Debs and rpms sure are nice. If you have the time, consider
packaging up whatever this module does so that we don't have to do things like
this.
