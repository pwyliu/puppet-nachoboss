## But I'm someone else...

If you found this repo and you want to do something similar, it's really
easy to use this as a template for your own setup. Check out `site.pp` and the
`workstation` module to get started. Also you might want to check out [boxen](http://boxen.github.com/),
which is like a totally way more awesome and better version of the same idea.
