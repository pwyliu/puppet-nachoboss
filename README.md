Puppet modules to set up a new Ubuntu workstation for myself.

Supports Trusty.

## But I'm someone else...

If you found this repo and you want to do something similar, it's really
easy to use this as a template for your own setup. Check out `site.pp` and the
`workstation` module to get started. Also you might want to check out [boxen](http://boxen.github.com/),
which is like a totally way more awesome and better version of the same idea.

## Engage

```bash
cd /tmp && wget -q -O engage.sh https://gist.githubusercontent.com/pwyliu/9737709/raw/engage.sh && bash engage.sh
```
